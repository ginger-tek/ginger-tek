# Welcome!
I'm a seasoned software engineer and developer focused on automation and web apps/APIs, building enterprise solutions, and creating web apps/libraries.

My language of choice atm is PHP 8+, due to its simplicity and robustness. I've been working a lot on a flat file CMS project and a router library, both taking advantage of the features and improvements of PHP 8+.

My other major project is a Vue.js UI Library  for the Pico CSS framework, which has been really fun learning how Vue libraries can be created.
